# Henchmen Hospital - _Survival is a roll of the dice_

Henchmen Hospital is a game where you strategically roll dice to heal injured henchmen. The game features roguelike game mechanics, with random items, random henchmen, and permanent death, ultimately creating a very replayable experience. Gameplay is also turn-based, allowing players to take their time and play at their own pace. The game will be web-hosted and playable from anywhere. Optional account creation is supported, allowing players to keep track of their personal bests.

The game will be available for free, allowing for very high accessibility. 

## Features
 - Many different types of quirky henchmen to heal, each with unique behaviors
 - Lots of items to make each run special and create different strategies.
 - Upgradeable die faces, allowing players to roll higher numbers and dish out even more healing
 - Multiple difficulties to appeal to more experienced players
 - Leaderboard functionality for comparing past runs

## Technical Details
The game is primarily built out of vanilla Javascript, PHP, and CSS. A MySQL database is used for storing and retrieving account information. The website will be hosted on Infinity Free to begin with so that we can take advantage of free hosting. To run the project, download the code and open it as a project in Visual Studio. The website will not work unless PHP is installed locally and a local database must also be created by running `generateLocalDB.sql` inside of MySQL.
